A react app that pulls in Strava Data from their API, and displays total Elv. Gained YTD from ALL activities.
The app is a "simple" project my boyfriend asked if I could do.  Many months later, and it's become a tool for learning various react / redux concepts.

### WORK IN PROGRESS

Using S3 bucket and Route 53 for hosting
Using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for concealing handshake with Strava.
